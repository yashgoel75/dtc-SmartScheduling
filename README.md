# Phoenix Bus Scheduling and Route Management System

### Overview
The Phoenix Bus Scheduling and Route Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and optimize the operations of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). The system automates bus scheduling, crew management, and route planning, enhancing operational efficiency and service reliability. Utilizing advanced data structures, machine learning algorithms, and GIS technologies, our system aims to address the current challenges faced by DTC's manual methods.

### Key Features
- **Linked Duty Scheduling:** Ensures a specific crew remains assigned to a bus throughout their shift, fostering familiarity and accountability.
- **Unlinked Duty Scheduling:** Facilitates the handover of buses between crews and manages crew rest periods for optimal resource utilization.
- **Route Management:** Provides a visual representation of all existing bus routes, enables the drawing of new routes, and highlights overlaps for better planning.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Anticipates demand and adjusts schedules dynamically to meet varying needs.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Continuously refines scheduling strategies, minimizing operational costs and improving service reliability.
- **Crew Management:** Monitors crew assignments, manages shift rotations, and ensures compliance with regulations.

### Proposed Technologies
- **Java:** Used for implementing core data structures and algorithms to handle complex scheduling and routing tasks.
- **Python:** Employed for machine learning algorithms, including predictive analytics, optimization, and reinforcement learning.
- **Flask/Django:** Backend framework to manage API requests and serve data efficiently.
- **React.js:** Frontend framework for building a user-friendly interface, allowing easy interaction with the system.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database management system to store route data, schedules, crew information, and more.
- **GIS Tools:** For mapping and spatial analysis, enabling the visualization of routes and geographical data.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** For containerization and orchestration, ensuring scalable and efficient deployment.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** Libraries used for machine learning model development and deployment.
- **SpaCy/NLTK:** Natural Language Processing tools for handling and processing text data.
